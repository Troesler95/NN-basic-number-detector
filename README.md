# Neural Network Basic Number Detector
This respository is a python-based simple number detector using neural networks. It also serves as a great resource for learning [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)!

It is inspired by my efforts to truly get a grasp of machine learning and artifical intelligence. Though I've taken coursework in college on the subject, 
I feel that it only introduced me to the basics of what being a machine learning/artificial intelligence engineer is truly about.

This is the standard "basic" project where I can deep dive into the subject and learn more about the concepts at play before building upon them in future projects.

Eventually, I would like to work my way up to rewriting my very simple [traffic sign recognition system](https://github.com/Troesler95/csit463-DIP) using more industry standards and best practices for a 
more complete system! For now, I will be developing in Python, but eventually would like to test the waters of the new Tensorflow library for JavaScript to bring ML to the browser.
